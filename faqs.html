    <div class="content">
        <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe 
            diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
        </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">What is a novel coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A novel coronavirus (CoV) is a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously identified in humans.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Can humans become infected with a novel coronavirus of animal source?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from civet cats to humans in China in 2002 and MERS-CoV 
          from dromedary camels to humans in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. 
          As surveillance improves around the world, more coronaviruses are likely to be identified.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">What are the symptoms of someone infected with a coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>It depends on the virus, but common signs include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. 
          In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.
      </p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Can coronaviruses be transmitted from person to person?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Yes, some coronaviruses can be transmitted from person to person, usually after close contact with an infected patient, for example, in a household workplace, or health care centre.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Is there a vaccine for a novel coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>When a disease is new, there is no vaccine until one is developed. It can take a number of years for a new vaccine to be developed.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Is there a treatment for a novel coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>There is no specific treatment for disease caused by a novel coronavirus. However, many of the symptoms can be treated and therefore treatment 
          based on the patientâ€™s clinical condition. Moreover, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">What can I do to protect myself?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Standard recommendations to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses include maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe 
          food practices  and avoiding close contact, when possible, with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">Are health workers at risk from a novel coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Yes, they can be, as health care workers come into contact with patients more often than the general public WHO recommends that health care workers consistently apply appropriate.</p>
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible btn btn-primary btn-lg btn-block">What WHO recommendations for countries?
    </button>
    <div class="content">
      <p>WHO encourages all countries to enhance their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), to carefully review any unusual patterns of SARI or pneumonia cases and to
           notify WHO of any suspected or confirmed case of infection with novel coronavirus. <br>
           <br> Countries are encouraged to continue strengthening their preparedness for health emergencies in line with the International Health Regulations (2005).
